# Learn Rust With Entirely Too Many Linked Lists

This repo is the code introducted in the book [Learn Rust With Entirely Too Many Linked Lists](http://rust-unofficial.github.io/too-many-lists/index.html) that I used to understand how Rust's `Box` and `Rc` works.
You can also check their github repository in [here](https://github.com/rust-unofficial/too-many-lists).

All the credits go for the people that worked on the book.
